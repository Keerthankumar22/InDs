# InDs
This work introduces an intelligent embedding framework named InDs. It utilizes an actor-critic model based on DRL architecture to make sequential decisions in a dynamic environment considering system and network features for solving the VNE problem. InDs tries to Maximize the acceptance  and revenue-to-cost ratio and minimize congestion.
